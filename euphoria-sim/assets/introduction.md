# Transgender Game Study

Thank you for participating in this research study! 

This study aims to assess your personal playing experience after playing a small video game developed by a transgender student team, which was designed to evoke experiences related to gender identity and well-being. We truly appreciate thoughtful and detailed responses. **Participants whose answers meaningfully contribute to the study may receive an additional bonus payment as a token of appreciation.**

The study has three sections: The first will show you explanations of the study objectives and procedures, as well as a digital consent form; the second section includes a peaceful game around exploring a friendly town and interacting with various characters to learn their stories; and, after finishing the game, the last section will show you a follow-up questionnaire that asks about your playing experiences.
