### About our use of the term/word "Trans" in the following questionnaire:

* People whose gender identity differs from what they were assigned at birth are trans or transgender. We use the word "trans" as inclusively as possible, to encompass any gender not assigned at birth, such as trans female, trans male, and trans nonbinary.
