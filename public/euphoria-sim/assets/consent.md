## Title of Research Study: 
Designing & Operationalizing Euphoria: Video Game Design and Development for Facilitating Transgender Players' Experiences of Gender Euphoria

## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation. This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Many transgender (and cisgender) people experience gender euphoria, which is a positive feeling of comfort and relief caused by gender-affirmative spaces or actions, affirmation from others, story-sharing, and congruence between oneâ€™s gender identity and experiences. The purpose of this study is to build a video game prototype based on previous transgender euphoria studies, investigate whether and how it can produce euphoric experiences for transgender players, and evaluate the performance of its gender identity-related designs in the video game.

## Tasks & Procedures
We are using reVISit (https://revisit.dev/) as the study and survey platform that functions similarly to Google Forms.

This page shows you explanations of the study objectives, procedures, and the digital consent form. After this page, the next section of the study will show you the video game for you to play. A game tutorial on the gameplay is included in the **Help** button on the top right corner of the website, accessible at any time during this study. The game involves exploring a quiet, friendly town and interacting with various transgender non-player characters (NPCs) to learn their stories. After finishing the game, you will be directed to a follow-up questionnaire that asks about your playing experience. Upon completing the questionnaire, you will receive a Prolific completion code on the final page. 

We will review your consent form signature, game playing records, and questionnaire answers, and make the approval, payment, and potential bonus payment in 1-2 days. At any point during the study, whether or not you have signed the consent form, you retain the privilege to withdraw from the study, and all of your data will be removed from any further investigation.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analysis. As such, your participation will remain anonymous, and your responses will not be used to identify you. When writing reports and academic publications, the researcher may quote from your answers without referring to the names of the individuals.

Besides, because both euphoria and dysphoria are idiosyncratic -- every trans person experiences it differently -- some game elements, while very unlikely, that are built for positive mental feelings, well-being, or euphoria in the video game, may be considered by individuals as gender dysphoria triggering. 

If you do not wish to perceive the relevant content at any point during the study, you retain the right to withdraw from the study, and all of your data will be removed from any further investigation.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
We will pay you for taking the study. At the end of this study, you will get a completion code to put back on the Prolific platform, which will then pay you in 1-2 days after we review your submission. Also, we truly appreciate contributing and detailed responses. Therefore, participants whose answers meaningfully contribute to the study may receive an **additional bonus payment** as a token of appreciation.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Data will be recorded by the online survey for analysis, and will appear in the report as diagrams and tables. All data will be anonymized before storing and analysis. The ID number given to you is how we will identify the data you generated in the study. As such, your participation will remain anonymous, and your responses will not be used to identify you. All data is stored in an encrypted password-controlled repository accessible only to project researchers. Informed consent will be administered using our online tool. 

Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you.

## Cost/Payment
Please check the Prolific description.
