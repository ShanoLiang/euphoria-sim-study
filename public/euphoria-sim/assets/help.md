# Gameplay Tutorial

Rainborough is a life simulation game with visual novel elements. You will play as a young adult who has just moved into the town of Rainborough and is beginning to explore the area. By interacting with a variety of transgender non-player characters (NPCs), youâ€™ll learn about their lives and experiences.

## 1. Customize your home:
One of the core gameplay features is decorating your room. We hope this aspect of the game offers a cozy and relaxing experience.

Click the **[Edit Room]** button to enter the customization mode. You can use your in-game money to purchase various items such as furniture, wallpaper, and flooring to personalize your space. Many items offer color customization options to reflect your preferences. If you would like to focus on editing furniture only, you can toggle off wall and floor selection using the **[allow select floors/walls]** switch in the upper right corner. To exit the customization mode, click the **[Edit Room]** button again.

## 2. Life simulation:
You can interact with items in your room -- such as clicking on your bed to rest. You can also click the **front door** to visit different locations in Rainborough. For example, you can go to your **workplace** to complete a shift and earn in-game money.
